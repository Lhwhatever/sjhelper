# Shengji Helper

This is a React app targeted to help users when playing the Chinese card game Shengji.

The goal is to explain various game configurations, track results and advancements, as well as explain the game.

This is a port of lhwhatever/shengji-helper to NextJS. You can view the production version [here](https://sjhelper.lhwhatever.vercel.app/). The port is currently not complete.
