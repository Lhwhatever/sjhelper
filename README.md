# Shengji Helper

This is a React app targeted to help users when playing the Chinese card game Shengji.

The goal is to explain various game configurations, track results and advancements, as well as explain the game.

This is a port of an older version of my project [lhwhatever/shengji-helper](https://github.com/Lhwhatever/shengji-helper) to NextJS. You can view the production version [here](https://sjhelper.lhwhatever.vercel.app/). The port is currently not complete.

## Planner (/planner)

This page aids you in planning the format of a game (for instance, how many decks), by showing you the number of cards that each player will have.

## Calculator (/calc)

This page leads to the true calculator. The set of format options for each game is known as a profile. You can create profiles and use the calculator to determine the correct outcome of each game by supplying it with the identity of the leader, defenders, and the number of points scored.
